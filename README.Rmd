### Credits

Several exercises have been taken from the excellent book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) and its [second edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz). A few of these exercises have been modified to better suit our needs. Please note that none of these changes have been approved by the authors of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).

<!-- Solutions to some of the exercises in the R4DS tutorial are based on  [R for Data Science Solution Manual](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/) written by Jeffrey Arnold. -->
